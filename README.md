# The Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers Technical Committee

The Integrated Software for Imagers and Spectrometers Technical Committee (TC)
is the technical governing body of the ISIS Software Package. Its role is 
to set policy for the ISIS project as described in the [TC Charter].


### ISIS

*ISIS* is defined as the contents of the repository located at
<https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3>. This is the location
of the ISIS low-level API and applications.

<!-- ### Dependent Projects

Additional projects fall within the TC's scope of responsibility which are
dependencies of ISIS in that they are **required** to plan, test, build,
document and ship ISIS Software releases.

These projects are located in the following repositories:

* https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/isis3_dependencies -->

<!-- ### Adjacent Projects

The TC is responsible for a number of projects that are not strictly
required to plan, test, build, document and ship ISIS releases.
Projects that are _adjacent_ are either created from within the
technical organization managed by the TC or are adopted into that
organization from outside.

Current adjacent projects that are within the TC's scope of responsibility
include:

## Strategic Initiatives

At any one time the ASC Software projects have a number of strategic initiatives
underway.  The goal of the TC is to have a champion for each of these
initiatives and to support the initiatives in order to enable their
success.
