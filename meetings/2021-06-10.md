## Agenda / Notes

- Action Items from last meeting
  - Schedule developer meeting about LTS needs
    - This happened earlier 6/10
    - notes will be posted on TC repo
      - Likely in release WG directory

- Developer comments on LTS
  - 1.5 year LTS length, start to EOL
  - 0.5 year LTS version overlap
    - Expected LTS transition every 18 months
  - View these as minimums and want the flexibility to tag new LTS version as needed
    - Decision needs to be made jointly by developers and users
    - Large changes need to be identified early for this process
    - What is the lead-time outside of the LTS version overlap?
  - There are some technical things that we can do to make this easier
  - Need process to tag bug-fix as being not backported

- Missions adding features
  - Changes are merged into dev and then need to either move to dev or get on next LTS
  - What are features developed against?
    - Mission teams may need features in LTS branches for their own use, but won't contribute upstream
      - Can come back and update to dev for upstream contribution
      - At least have a maintained development environment for LTS version
  - Need to coordinate changes and LTS releases around mission needs
- Can features be added to LTS branches?
  - ISIS's structure allows for targeted changes to many mission components such as camera models or calibration
  - Goes against the idea of a stable LTS
  - Modular approach to ISIS
    - Core ISIS components
    - Plugin/modular mission components
      - Camera models are already plugins
    - Independent updates for mission and core libraries
    - Java has a great setup for this stuff
- Need to determine what versions people are on
  - Need to determine if people are using the LTS model
  - Could watch Anaconda downloads
- Need to publish some type of roadmap for updgrade planning and transparency
- This does not resolve all of the issues for missions
  - Particularly, feature development is still a concern
    - See discussion above
  - This brings groups closer together than they are right now
    - It is likely that different mission teams will branch off of the LTS versions
    - Effectively creating mission forks
  - Validation time is still significant
    - Science validation is particularly time consuming
    - Testing and validation improvements work well with this part
- dev
  - Fewer dev releases?
    - Active missions need rapid changes that LTS cannot support
    - Continuous deployment would be great
      - Can be dangerous for users to develop software on top of dev releases
      - Concerns about changes in data areas breaking previous dev releases
    - Fewer version ticks?
  - Who uses dev releases?
  - Is this entirely developer driven?
  - Release managers (ASC) decides how often to release dev
    - Needs to be transparently communicated

- Integration testing and validation

- Open discussion

## Discussions for next meeting
