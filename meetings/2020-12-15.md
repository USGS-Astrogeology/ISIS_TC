- Collecting Epic Changes
  - How do we propose, discuss, and evaluate large scale changes to ISIS?
    - Examples of such changes:
      - redoing the ISIS website and documentation
      - Creating a C interface for ISIS
      - Separating the Library and applications
      - Introducing a deprecation policy
  - Why this is coming up
    - At ASC we are asking "does this change need an RFC?"
    - Community members and contributors are asking for large changes that are sparking discussion
      - [ISIS #3450](https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/issues/3450) is a major concern that could use a better way to get to a solution
  - Currently:
    - RFCs
      - Wiki page with accompanying issue
      - Done before work starts
      - Issue is posted for discussion
      - Accept/reject mechanism is unclear
    - Pull Requests
      - At what point does a pull request need an RFC?
      - What about feature branches?
      - Work has to be completed for discussion to start
  - How do other software projects handle this?
    - OpenCV uses [Evolution Proposals](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/Evolution-Proposals)
    - Python uses [PEPs](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/)
  - What do we want out of such a process?
    - Some sort of guidance for answering "does this need community input" and "how do I get community input"
    - What is the approval/disapproval/request changes process for these?
      - The ultimate goal is to facilitate contribution, we don't want a huge pile of red tape
  - We have had good traction with issues being started and discussion going from there
    - Jesse will post an issue on ISIS_TC repo and cross link on the ISIS repo
