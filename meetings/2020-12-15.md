## Agenda / Notes

- Action Items from last meeting
  - LROC release stories
  - Kris release stories
  - TSC application governance update

- Release Working Group

- Collecting Epic Changes
  - How do we propose, discuss, and evaluate large scale changes to ISIS?
    - Examples of such changes:
      - redoing the ISIS website and documentation
      - Creating a C interface for ISIS
      - Separating the Library and applications
      - Introducing a deprecation policy
  - Currently:
    - RFCs
      - Wiki page with accompanying issue
      - Done before work starts
      - Accept/reject mechanism is unclear
    - Pull Requests
      - At what point does a pull request need an RFC?
      - What about feature branches?
      - Work has to be completed for discussion to start
  - How do other software projects handle this?
    - OpenCV uses [Evolution Proposals](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/wiki/Evolution-Proposals)
    - Python uses [PEPs](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/)
  - What do we want out of such a process?
