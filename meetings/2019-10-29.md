    - The ASC Technical Steering Committee
      - In December of 2018, the ASC Technical Steering Committee was established to
        govern all of the open source software in the ASC.
      - This group quickly found themselves discussing topics not related to specific
        software at the ASC and re-organized as the Planetary Software Technical Steering Committee.
    - The [Planetary Software Technical Steering Committee](https://github.com/planetarysoftware/TSC)
      - This group discusses general governance concepts for open source software
        that is used in planetary science. An early goal of the ISIS TC is to
        be accepted as a Top Level Project under the Planetary Software TSC.
