## Agenda / Notes


- Action Items from last meeting
  - Jesse will review the contributing document and start an issue with what needs to be updated on it
  - Ross will post on astrodiscuss about the data area versioning and transition

  - 1 year LTS
    - USGS Astrogeology dev input
      - ASC can execute the mechanics of an LTS model.
      - ASC does not believe that this is a solution that meets the needs as understood. 
      - Unclear how an LTS model helps all users? This helps a limited number of people in a very specific way:
         - This does help small projects
         - This does help projects on a 1 to 1.5-year cycle
         - This does not help active missions/users that want a very short turn around
         - This does not support long life pipeline users
      - We are concerned this is a process change that may or may not meet stakeholder requirements. Having better defined requirements would allow for this group (the TC) to determine what user requirements are.
      - A requirements document (possibly partitioned by user type) from the ISIS TC would support development of a plan. Should this happen in this group of in a small team drawn from the TC?
         - Potential requirements to address:
           - Release cadence
           - Release stability 
           - Release lifecycle (when is a release considered unsupported?)
           - Backporting project contributions
         - ASC has a notes document it can share with a group, should one be stood up
    
    - Feature release cadence
    - Bug fix release cadence
    - Final plan and implementation schedule
      - Committee to write this?
