## Agenda / Notes

- Action Items from last meeting
  - Jesse : Close #133 with comment about maintaining status quo
    - Done
  - Jesse : Updated release schedule page on wiki
    - Done
    - https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/wiki/Release-Schedule
  - All : come up with some actionable things for the releases

- Release working group findings
  - Need for validation and documentation around expected changes
    - Long standing missions cannot update as fast as versions are coming out
    - pipeline validation is very time consuming on both technical and science sides
  - General anxiety around version number ticking
    - ISIS version used to tick very slowly
    - Now it ticks much faster due to new versioning policy
  - Hard to target upgrades because by the time an upgrade is complete the version is not supported

- How do we want to change releases?
  - Fewer feature releases
    - Could be 1 RC and 1 feature release every 4 or 6 months instead of 3
    - Number of changes in time period does not change
  - Better user education
    - Send hot chocolate with every release
    - Better release documentation

  - Release candidates
    - What is the correct window for a release candidate
    - Some ad hoc internal testing at the USGS
    - Release branch structure
```
    dev ------- RC ---- feature a -- bug ------ feature b ---->
                 \                    \
    1.0           \ ------------------- RC 2 ------- full release
```
    - 2 second release candidates in the last ~2 years
    - Removing release candidates
      - Do more bug fix releases
```
    dev ------- release 1.0 ---- feature a -- bug ------ feature b ---->
                 \                             \
    1.0           \ --------------------------- Release 1.0.1
```
      - Normal releases get about the same "user testing" as release candidates anyway
      - We can better use this developer time
  - Setup a formal testing process prior to releases
    - Community effort
    - There are testing and validation efforts happening in the community already
      - Varies from group to group
    - Science validation is very time consuming and not very automatable
    - Can we do this less frequently than the ISIS releases
    - Develop a unified validation/testing framework
      - More user/pipeline focused than developer testing
      - Kris has developed some MESSENGER control scripts that could help with this
      - Integration testing
      - Pulling data off the web
      - LROC is also working on automating their validation
  - Long term support releases
    - Long term support < 1 year is not valueable
    - USGS is comfortable with 2 release "channels" sometimes 3
    - 1.5 year LTS with 6 month overlaps between LTS versions
    - 2.5 year LTS with 6 month overlaps between LTS versions

- Open discussion
  - No time

## Discussions for next meeting

- Long Term Support
  - USGS is comfortable with 2 release "channels" sometimes 3
  - 1.5 year LTS with 6 month overlaps between LTS versions
  - 2.5 year LTS with 6 month overlaps between LTS versions
- Integration testing and validation

## Action Items

- Kris: Upload MESSENGER scripts

## Next Meeting

- May 13th @ 1pm MST
