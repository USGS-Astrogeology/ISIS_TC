# Onboarding/Offboarding

Please refer to the text on Membership in the [TC Charter](TC-Charter.md).
In the event that there is a contradiction between that document
and this document, the contradictory elements in this document are
invalid and are superseded by the TC Charter.

## Onboarding

* Confirm that the new member has read, understands, and agrees to uphold the
  [Code of Conduct](Code-Of-Conduct.md).
<!-- * Add the new member to the `@USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS_TC` team. -->
<!-- * Change the new member's role in the GitHub `USGS-Astrogeology` organization to `Owner`. -->
* Update the repository Members to reflect membership in the TC.

## Offboarding

<!-- * Remove the member to the `@USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS_TC` team. -->
<!-- * Change the member's role in the GitHub `USGS-Astrogeology` organization to `Member`
  unless they have `Owner` role for a reason other than TC membership. -->
* Update the repository Members to reflect membership in the TC.
  In all likelihood, they should be listed as TC Emeritus.
